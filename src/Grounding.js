                Grounding is a useful tool when you don't really feel completely present in a room, are having a flashback, or your emotions are compelling
                you to relive a difficult, traumatic memory. 

                So ask yourself: What are five things you can see? 
                What are four things you can hear? 
                What are three things you can touch? 
                What are two things you can smell? 
                What is one thing you can taste?
            </div>
        )

    }
}
